# $\textsf{\color{#ed8428}{California Community Colleges Policy Assistant}}$ 

Welcome to the California Community Colleges Policy Assistant (CCC Policy Assistant) repo. Here we are experimenting on building Artificial Intelligence tools to help users easily improve their understanding of policy topics related to California's community colleges. This is an experimental open-source project designed to demonstrate the benefits of constructing and employing focussed datasets. Specifically, we show how
1. Valuable and differentiated datasets can be created (in this case using publicly available data)
2. Such datasets can be leveraged to inform, support and even accelerate public-policy work.


## Getting started

We use Anaconda to create a virtual environment. You can find the `environment.yml` file in the `\data\environment` directory. Using a Macbook, you can run the following Anaconda command from the Terminal

```
conda env create --platform osx-arm64 -f environment.yml
```
You'll need to select this interrupter in your development environment. See other notes for more on environments.
