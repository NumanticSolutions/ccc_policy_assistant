CCC Has Broad Mission. The CCC system is one of California’s three public higher education segments. The system consists of 115 colleges operated by 72 locally governed districts located throughout the state, plus one statewide online community college administered by the Board of Governors. The colleges offer a breadth of academic programs, including lower‑division transferable coursework, career technical education, precollegiate basic skills instruction, and citizenship classes. The state also allows community colleges to offer baccalaureate degrees in certain occupational fields as long as they do not duplicate the programs offered by the University of California (UC) or the California State University (CSU).

This brief analyzes the Governor’s budget proposals for CCC. We begin by describing the Governor’s overall budget plan for CCC and providing our high‑level assessment of that plan. The next four sections of the brief focus on CCC enrollment, apportionments, a loophole related to summer enrollment, and nursing education, respectively. Within those sections, we identify a few opportunities for the Legislature to achieve budget savings. The last section covers other opportunities the Legislature has to achieve one‑time and ongoing budget savings. In this section, we first cover major Proposition 98 proposals impacting community colleges. We then assess the Governor’s overall Proposition 98 plan for the colleges and provide associated high‑level recommendations.

Commonly known as the “minimum guarantee,” this funding requirement is met through a combination of state General Fund and local property tax revenue. Since the 2023‑24 budget was enacted, the administration has revised its estimates of state General Fund revenues down substantially. These downward revenue revisions in turn lead to significant downward revisions in the administration’s estimates of the Proposition 98 minimum guarantee from 2022‑23 through 2024‑25. As Figure 1 shows, the minimum guarantee is down even further in 2023‑24 and 2024‑25 under our February 2024 estimates. We discuss these estimates in more detail in The 2024‑25 Budget: Proposition 98 and K‑12 Education Analysis. State Faces Unusually Large Drop in 2022‑23 Proposition 98 Guarantee.

Previous downward revisions to the prior‑year guarantee have been no more than a few hundreds of millions of dollars. The administration attributes the unusually large adjustment primarily to the late tax filing deadline for 2022 returns (November rather than April 2023) and the lack of reliable revenue data prior to budget enactment in June 2023. Governor Proposes Large Budget Maneuver Relating to Reduction in 2022‑23 Guarantee. The Governor proposes to realign Proposition 98 spending with the revised estimate of the minimum guarantee in 2022‑23. The main way the Governor addresses the reduction in the guarantee is by proposing to reclassify $8 billion in Proposition 98 General Fund payments already made to schools and community colleges. Of the $8 billion, $910 million would be attributed to community colleges. The $8 billion would be reclassified as non‑Proposition 98 General Fund payments,'),\n",

This maneuver would not reduce any previous funding provided to colleges or attempt to recoup any of this funding in subsequent years—districts would retain the associated cash they originally received. Rather than colleges being affected, the impact of the maneuver would occur entirely on the non‑Proposition 98 side of the budget beginning in 2025‑26. In effect, the state would be borrowing from future non‑Proposition 98 funds to pay for 2022‑23 school and college spending. Unlike a traditional loan, however, the state would not score this mechanism as borrowing, make payments to an external creditor, or accrue any interest.

The main way the Governor proposes to address the lower guarantee and higher costs is by making a $3 billion discretionary withdrawal from the Proposition 98 Reserve. Of this amount, the Governor proposes using $236 million to cover ongoing community college apportionment costs. (We discuss apportionment costs in more detail in the “Apportionments” section of this brief.) Governor Proposes Increasing CCC Spending in 2024‑25. Despite not having sufficient Proposition 98 funds to cover existing Proposition 98 program costs, the Governor’s budget contains some Proposition 98 program augmentations in 2024‑25. As Figure 2 shows, the largest CCC proposal is to provide apportionments with $69 million to cover a 0.76 percent COLA—the same COLA rate proposed for the K‑12 Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF).

To cover his new proposed CCC spending in 2024‑25, the Governor proposes to make another discretionary withdrawal from the Proposition 98 Reserve. For schools and colleges combined, the Governor proposes to withdraw $2.6 billion. Of this amount, $486 million would be used for ongoing community college apportionment costs. Under the Governor’s plan, $3.9 billion in Proposition 98 reserves would remain available entering 2025‑26. Proposed Budget Maneuver Worsens State’s Out‑Year Deficits. We have major concerns with the Governor’s proposed budget maneuver for addressing the drop in the 2022‑23 guarantee.

The Governor’s proposed maneuver contributes to these projected budget deficits over the outlook period and beyond (through 2029‑30). Carrying $8 billion in effectively greater internal debt would make balancing the state budget more difficult in the coming years. Moreover, the impact would be felt fully on the non‑Proposition 98 side of the budget—potentially at the expense of health care programs, social services, and other state programs beyond education. The maneuver sets problematic fiscal precedent by borrowing from the future to pay for past operating costs. We describe these and other concerns in more detail in The 2024‑25 Budget: The Governor’s Proposition 98 Funding Maneuver. Proposed CCC Operating Shortfall Worsens CCC Budget Outlook.

Under the Governor’s plan, community colleges would enter 2025‑26 with a $486 million apportionment shortfall. The Governor’s plan also leaves schools with a nearly $2.2 billion LCFF shortfall entering 2025‑26. These combined shortfalls mean the first $2.7 billion of any new Proposition 98 funding in 2025‑26 would need to go first to backfilling funding gaps in existing programs. Entering 2025‑26 with existing operating shortfalls means both existing programs are at greater risk of cuts and any new priorities are less likely to be addressed. Governor’s Plan Misses Opportunities to Achieve CCC Savings. The Governor’s plan relies solely on his proposed budget maneuver and drawing down Proposition 98 Reserves. Other than caseload and technical adjustments, the Governor’s plan includes no components aimed at lowering CCC spending, despite the state’s revised budget outlook.

Moreover, the savings opportunities that could be achieved now (like reverting unallocated funds from prior‑year initiatives) would have little negative impact on districts. By missing these opportunities now, the Governor’s plan makes realigning CCC spending with available Proposition 98 funding even more difficult moving forward. Use Proposition 98 Reserves in Place of Funding Maneuver to Address 2022‑23 Drop in Guarantee. Under the Governor’s plan, the state would be using Proposition 98 reserves to increase CCC spending amid budget deficits. We recommend the Legislature take a more prudent approach and use the reserves instead to address the large decline in the 2022‑23 minimum guarantee. We think reserves provide the greatest benefit for the state budget—and for colleges—when the state is facing a large, unexpected shortfall and would need to adopt disruptive alternatives if it did not'),\n",

The significant drop in the prior‑year guarantee meets these conditions in 2022‑23. In contrast to the Governor’s proposed maneuver, using reserves to address the 2022‑23 shortfall would work within an existing legal framework, avoid setting a problematic fiscal precedent, and not worsen future state budget deficits. It also would be consistent with the state’s original rationale for creating the Proposition 98 Reserve account. Identify More CCC Budget Solutions to Address 2023‑24 Drop in Guarantee. Based on our February 2024 estimates of the 2023‑24 minimum guarantee, the Legislature is facing an approximately $800 million gap that year between available Proposition 98 CCC funding and existing CCC spending. If the Legislature used Proposition 98 reserves to address the 2022‑23 situation, it would have approximately $175 million in Proposition 98 reserves remaining to support CCC program spending in 2023‑24.

Pulling back these funds could yield potentially enough savings to address the entire CCC budget gap in 2023‑24. Hold Core CCC Spending Flat in 2024‑25.

The “Budget Solutions” section of this brief identifies a number of options that would result in ongoing General Fund savings. Total Funding for CCC in 2024‑25 Is Up From Revised 2023‑24 Level. Under the Governor’s budget, total funding for the colleges would reach $18.4 billion in 2024‑25, a 2.8 percent increase over the revised 2023‑24 level. As Figure 3 shows, non‑Proposition 98 General Fund support would increase by just over 9 percent ($55 million) in 2024‑25, largely due to an increase in debt service payments on state general'),\n",

The Governor’s Budget Summary indicates that the administration is committed to using a state lease revenue bond approach for financing the remaining 13 CCC projects.

That is, all persons 18 years or older may attend a community college. (While CCC does not deny admission to students, there is no guarantee of access to a particular class.) Many factors affect the number of students who attend community colleges, including changes in the state’s population, particularly among young adults; local economic conditions, particularly the local job market; the availability of certain classes; and the perceived value of the education to potential students. Prior to the Pandemic, CCC Enrollment Had Plateaued. Following the Great Recession, as the economy and state funding began recovering (2012‑13 through 2015‑16), systemwide CCC enrollment grew. As Figure 4 shows, CCC enrollment flattened thereafter. The plateau in CCC enrollment during this period was commonly attributed to the long economic expansion, strong labor market, and unemployment remaining at or near record lows. CCC Enrollment Dropped Notably During the Pandemic. As Figure 4 also'),\n",

The drop in CCC enrollment was consistent with national community college enrollment trends over this period. While CCC enrollment declines over these years affected virtually every student demographic group, most districts reported the largest enrollment declines among African American, male, lower‑income, and older adult students. These group‑specific impacts also were consistent with national trends. Enrollment Levels Are Increasing in Many Districts. After three years of enrollment drops, data from the Chancellor’s Office indicates that enrollment rose overall in 2022‑23—increasing by an estimated 4 percent (in FTE terms) over 2021‑22 levels.

Fall 2023 data will not be released by the Chancellor’s Office until late February 2024, but some data suggests continued growth in 2023‑24. Based on information our office received in January 2024 directly from 20 districts (representing more than one‑quarter of districts in the state), fall 2023 enrollment was strong, with districts reporting growth over fall 2022 levels of between 4 percent and 18 percent. This data suggests more districts are likely to return to their pre‑pandemic levels over the next couple of years. Several Factors Likely Contributing to Recent Enrollment Increases. District administrators cite a number of reasons for the recent rebound in enrollment. Unemployment in the state has ticked up over the past year (increasing from 3.8 percent in September 2022 to 5.1 percent by December 2023), which likely has resulted in more individuals deciding to earn a CCC education. Many districts also have indicated they have increased enrollment'),\n",

Additionally, colleges have increased outreach to local high schools, and many colleges have created phone banks to contact individuals who recently dropped out of college or had completed a CCC application recently but did not register for classes. In addition, a number of colleges have begun to offer more flexible courses, with shorter terms and more frequent start dates (rather than only offering typical semester start dates). State Has Certain Rules for Allocating Enrollment Growth Funds Across Districts. Statute does not specify how the state is to go about determining how much CCC growth funding to provide in any given year. Historically, the state has considered several state‑level factors, including changes in the adult population, the unemployment rate, and prior‑year enrollment trends. When the state funds growth, it provides districts with a uniform rate for'),\n",

(The weighted average rate is about $5,400 per student in 2023‑24.) The Chancellor’s Office uses a statutory formula to allocate that enrollment growth funding across districts. The allocation formula takes into account several local‑level factors, including local rates of educational attainment, unemployment, poverty, and enrollment. Funding for districts that are unable to reach their budgeted growth targets is eventually redistributed to other districts who grow beyond those targets. Unused Growth Funds May Be Used for Backfilling Apportionment Shortfalls. For many years, the annual budget act has contained provisional language allowing the CCC Chancellor’s Office to allocate unused systemwide enrollment growth funding to backfill any shortfalls in CCC apportionment funding. Shortfalls can occur as a result of colleges generating lower‑than‑budgeted enrollment fee revenue or local property tax revenue. The provisional budget'),\n",

The Governor’s budget includes $30 million ongoing Proposition 98 General Fund for 0.5 percent systemwide CCC enrollment growth in 2024‑25. This equates to about 5,400 additional FTE students. The average base rate for each of these students is $5,440. To be eligible for these growth funds, a district must first recover to its pre‑pandemic enrollment level.

Student demand also might increase in 2024‑25 if the state’s unemployment rate continues to tick upward, the job market weakens, or entry‑level wage growth slows. These developments often are accompanied by an increase in the number of individuals seeking reskilling or upskilling. By providing funding for enrollment growth in 2024‑25, the state could encourage and reward districts for expanding access to students. Countering these growth pressures, however, is demographic data indicating declines in both the college‑age population (ages 18‑24) and the broader working‑age adult population (ages 25‑64) in the state.

Most community college employees are represented by labor unions. Several unions represent faculty throughout the state, with the largest being the California Federation of Teachers. The California School Employees Association is the main union for classified staff. Each community college negotiates with the local branches of these unions. Through collective bargaining agreements, community college districts and their employees make key compensation decisions, including salary decisions.

For tenure and tenure‑track faculty, the average salary has been growing slightly quicker than inflation, reaching $114,630 in 2022. Districts Are Likely to Feel Some Salary Pressure in 2024‑25. Between 2021‑22 and 2022‑23, both inflation and wage growth (across the nation and in California) were at their highest levels in several decades. Although inflation and wage growth among workers have slowed noticeably over the past year, both are likely to remain above historical averages for the next few years. As a result, community college districts are likely to continue feeling pressure to provide their employees with salary increases.

Similar to other education segments, community college districts generally also expect to see higher costs in 2024‑25 for health care premiums, insurance, equipment, supplies, and utilities. Health care costs are the largest of these remaining cost pressures. Districts are likely to face even greater pressure in this area than normal, as premiums in 2024 are increasing at historically high rates. Cost drivers include new medical technologies, increases in prescription drug costs, and inflation. Districts generally cover premium increases for their respective health care plans, though those decisions are collectively bargained.

The state typically provides apportionment funding with a COLA to help districts cover operating cost increases. In most cases, districts, in turn, negotiate a COLA rate with their bargaining units. In negotiating a COLA rate with employee unions, districts typically take into account a number of factors, including changes in the costs of housing and other expenses for employees, the competitiveness of salaries relative to other districts, and the need for the district to address non‑salary cost pressures (such as pension liabilities and cost increases to utilities and other operating expenses). A relatively small proportion of districts (likely less than 10 percent) automatically apply any state‑funded COLA rate to employees.

Part‑time faculty—which historically have made up nearly half of all CCC employees—experienced the largest decline (14 percent in both FTE and headcount terms). This decline was due to districts offering fewer course sections as a result of lower enrollment. When districts reduce course sections, they typically reduce their use of part‑time faculty, who are hired as temporary employees, compared to full‑time faculty, who are hired as permanent employees. Most districts across the state have been affected by enrollment declines and, in turn, have experienced staffing reductions.

All community college districts (except the statewide online Calbright College) receive funding from apportionments. The amount each district receives is based on the state’s Student Centered Funding Formula (SCFF). SCFF takes into account many factors, including the amount of credit and noncredit instruction each district provides.

Apportionment Funding Has Increased Significantly Over Past Three Years. Although the state is not statutorily required to provide a COLA for apportionments (as it is for school districts’ LCFF), the state has a long‑standing practice of providing a COLA when Proposition 98 funds are available.

Moreover, actual funding per student is significantly above budgeted funding per student. Though enrollment has dropped since 2018‑19, funding has not been adjusted accordingly.

Funding Increases, Together With Budget Savings, Contributed to Higher Reserve Levels. The increase in districts’ local reserves is the result of at least three factors. One factor is that the state notably increased community college funding during the pandemic years despite enrollment drops. Given enrollment drops and large state augmentations (even beyond high COLA rates), districts purposefully have tended not to spend all their state allotments the past few years. Additionally, federal relief funds provided during the pandemic reduced pressure on local and state funds that colleges would otherwise have'),\n",

Amid these federal and state funding increases, colleges also achieved savings from staff reductions and vacancies. Governor Proposes COLA for Apportionments and Certain Categorical Programs. The Governor’s budget includes $69 million to cover a 0.76 percent COLA for apportionments. This is the same COLA rate the Governor proposes for the K‑12 LCFF. The Governor’s budget also includes a 0.76 percent COLA for seven CCC categorical programs, at a total cost of $9 million. The COLA rate is based on a particular price index, as described in more detail in the nearby box. The COLA rate will be revised in late April, as new data from the federal government is released at that time. Lower Energy Costs May Be a Factor Behind Low COLA Rate.

Costs for employee wages and benefits are the largest factor affecting the index, but other factors, including costs for fuel, utilities, supplies, equipment, and facilities, also affect the index. The 0.76 percent COLA rate in the Governor’s budget is below the historical average of about 3 percent. One key factor likely contributing to the low COLA rate in 2024‑25 is the recent decline in energy prices. The COLA rate for the budget year is based on prices for the 12‑month period ending in March 2024 compared to the previous 12‑month period (April 2022 through March 2023). Energy prices peaked in summer 2022 and have since fallen. Given energy prices are among the most volatile of all the factors contributing to the index, they can have an outsized effect on the COLA rate.

Districts generally also have relatively high local reserves that could be tapped to address cost increases that are unavoidable in the near term (such as higher health care premiums or software licenses and other technology). The impact of not providing a COLA in 2024‑25 also might be mitigated by a weakening statewide labor market and slowing wage growth, making it easier for districts to recruit and retain employees. In this section, we first provide background on SCFF, the rules for counting and reporting enrollment, and a new CCC funding protection. We then describe how a CCC policy on reporting summer enrollment will increase apportionment costs over the next several years.

For each of these three components, the state sets funding rates. About 70 percent of districts’ SCFF funding is from the base allocation linked to enrollment. Enrollment Is Counted on the “Census Date.” Community college districts typically operate four academic terms—the primary fall and spring terms, along with shorter summer and winter intercessions (often about half of the length of the primary terms). Unlike K‑12 schools, which are funded on students’ daily attendance, most community college enrollment is based on the number of students enrolled in a course on the census date. The census date is a point defined in CCC regulations as one‑fifth into a given academic term. Regulations Give Districts Flexibility on Reporting Summer Enrollment.

(For example, data for the summer 2021 term through spring 2022 term were used for these components of the 2021‑22 SCFF calculations.) For many years, CCC regulations have contained a loophole for summer enrollment. For SCFF calculations, summer classes that have a census date in one fiscal year and end in the following fiscal year may be reported in either fiscal year. Under these regulations, districts are allowed to “double up” summer enrollment in a given fiscal year—for example, counting both summer 2021 and summer 2022 enrollment to their 2021‑22 SCFF enrollment calculations.

(As discussed in the “Enrollment” section of this brief, many districts are benefiting from these provisions given their enrollment is down notably from pre‑pandemic levels.) The 2022‑23 budget modified one of these funding protections by setting a new hold harmless funding level. Specifically, beginning in 2025‑26, districts are to receive no less total apportionment funding than they received in 2024‑25. The intent of this policy is to provide a funding floor for districts experiencing enrollment declines. In addition, because the hold harmless amount will not grow by COLA each year, the intent is to eventually move all districts off the hold harmless provision and into the regular SCFF formula calculations (whereby districts have incentives to enroll low‑income students and have good outcomes for all students).

Over the next few years, using the summer loophole will become even more appealing to districts. This is because many districts likely will be on hold harmless in 2025‑26 due to recent enrollment declines. In order to maximize this funding, they have an incentive to push as much enrollment as they can into 2023‑24. By doing so, they could boost their funding level in 2024‑25 by taking advantage of a different funding protection known as stability. (Some growing districts could receive more funding using the summer loophole if instead they push summer enrollments into 2024‑25.)

Estimating the cost of the summer loophole, however, is difficult given final 2023‑24 enrollment and funding data, including summer 2024 data, are not yet available. Based on our discussions with several districts and some preliminary modeling, we estimate the loophole could result in roughly $100 million in additional costs annually from 2024‑25 through 2026‑27, for a total of about $300 million in costs. SCFF costs likely would continue to be a few millions of dollars higher beyond 2026‑27, until all districts reach enrollment levels moving them off the hold harmless provision.

Summer Loophole Distorts Enrollment Data. Beyond these issues, the summer loophole can obscure actual enrollment trends. A district could report an enrollment decrease between two years, for example, but that may be due solely to its decision to report two summers’ worth of enrollment in the prior year. The summer loophole thus makes enrollment tracking and legislative oversight more difficult. Recommend Legislature Close Summer Loophole. We recommend the Legislature specify in statute that the summer term is to be the first term counted in a fiscal year and summer‑term enrollment is to be reported only once each fiscal year.

(In addition, counting summer term as the first term of the fiscal year is the same as CSU’s and UC’s policy.) It also would eliminate a loophole that would otherwise drive up the cost of the formula substantially over the next few years. Finally, our recommendation would make enrollment reporting more meaningful and allow for improved legislative oversight.

RNs Must Be Licensed to Work in California. California’s more than 300,000 RNs provide a variety of health care services in various settings, including hospitals, medical offices and clinics, extended care facilities, and laboratories.

To obtain a license, students must graduate from an approved nursing program, pass a national licensing examination, and complete certain other steps (such as undergoing a criminal background check). Students Have Three Main Education Routes to Becoming a Nurse. In California, three main types of pre‑licensure education programs are available to persons seeking to become an RN.

The third route is for students to enroll in a university program culminating in a Master’s of Science in Nursing (MSN) degree. Pre‑licensure master’s programs accept individuals who hold a bachelor’s degree in a non‑nursing field. Generally, students in such a master’s program complete educational requirements for an RN license in about 18 months, then continue for another 18 months to obtain an MSN. All three types of pre‑licensure programs combine classroom instruction, “hands on” training in a simulation lab, and clinical placement in a hospital or other health facility.

State Faced Nursing Shortage Throughout the 2000s. Beginning in the 1990s, health care employers indicated that the size of the nursing workforce was insufficient to adequately staff health care facilities—particularly hospitals, which are statutorily required to maintain minimum nurse‑to‑patient ratios. Despite paying higher wages and encouraging—and in some cases requiring—existing staff to work overtime, the state continued to experience a gap between supply of and demand for RNs throughout the 2000s.

As a result of these and other factors (including an increase in the number of private colleges launching nursing programs), the number of students annually graduating and obtaining an RN license more than doubled during the 2000s—from about 5,100 graduates in 2000‑01 to 10,600 graduates by 2010‑11. Prior to Pandemic, Nursing Workforce Was in Good Shape Overall. According to a 2017 forecast prepared by the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) for the Board of Registered Nursing, the number of nursing graduates in the state (approximately 11,000 per year across the state’s pre‑licensure programs) likely was sufficient to ensure an adequate nursing workforce in the state through at least 2027.

In addition, the UCSF report cautioned that reductions in the employment rates of older RNs could affect the forecast. Nursing Shortage Re‑Emerged as a Result of the Pandemic. During the pandemic, many older RNs left nursing and some younger RNs quit their nursing jobs due to higher stress levels and family or other personal considerations. In addition, many pre‑licensure nursing education programs experienced enrollment declines due to social distancing requirements, reduced access to clinical sites, and less student demand. These factors resulted in a reduction of the supply of RNs compared with previous projections and a mismatch between supply and demand. According to a February 2024 report by UCSF (unpublished), there currently is an estimated statewide supply‑demand gap of 17,000 FTE nurses.'),\n",

All three types of pre‑licensure nursing programs anticipate further growth in the coming years. The number of new graduates from these programs is anticipated to fill more of the expected job openings. Given these developments, UCSF forecasts that the supply‑demand mismatch will gradually decline over the next few years, closing entirely by 2028.

Also, the study cautions that even were supply numbers to match demand on a statewide basis, regional differences could persist. Main Source of CCC Nursing Funding Is Apportionments. Just like other types of instruction, community college districts claim apportionment funding (through SCFF) for each FTE student enrolled in one of their nursing programs. Under SCFF, community college districts receive additional funding if an enrolled student is low income and for each successful student outcome (including graduation). We estimate that community college districts generated about $100 million in SCFF funding for the 11,845 FTE nursing students enrolled in 2022‑23 (about $8,500 per actual FTE student).

The underlying rationale for SWP is that some programs (just like nursing) have especially high costs due to equipment and low student‑faculty ratios.

Currently, 22 community colleges (about 30 percent of all community colleges) partner with the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) to provide in‑person courses.

Most of these people (97 percent) are housed in one of the 32 prisons owned and operated by the state. Currently, the state has 30 men’s prisons and 2 women’s prisons. The remaining people incarcerated by the state are housed in various specialized facilities outside of prisons, such as conservation camps and community reentry facilities. Depending on the severity of the crime and several other factors (including the length of court proceedings), people can spend less than one year in prison or the remainder of their life. On average, a person spends about three to four years in prison before release. CDCR Offers Rehabilitation Programs to Reduce Recidivism, Among Other Benefits. Some'),\n",

Some people reoffend after they are released from prison. Specifically, of the roughly 36,000 people released from California’s state prisons in 2018‑19, about 15,100 (42 percent) were convicted of a subsequent crime within three years of release. The primary goal of rehabilitation programs is to reduce the level of recidivism—the number of people that reoffend after release. If rehabilitation programs are successful at reducing recidivism, they in turn can result in fiscal benefits to the state, such as reducing incarceration costs and increasing employment. In addition, rehabilitation programs can serve other goals, such as increasing individuals’ educational attainment and reducing the prevalence of substance use disorders.

Beyond these types of instruction, state law tasks CDCR with making postsecondary programs available at every prison for people who have obtained a high school diploma or equivalent. Specifically, Chapter 766 of 2021 (SB 416, Hueso) requires that postsecondary instruction be provided by CCC; CSU; UC; or other regionally accredited, nonprofit colleges or universities.

Enrollment Growth in CCC Courses Was Strong Leading Up to the Pandemic. As Figure 2 shows, CCC enrollment of incarcerated students in state prisons increased from about 1,400 FTE students in 2015‑16 to nearly 5,500 FTE students in 2018‑19—almost quadrupling within just four years. Growth in enrollment among incarcerated students can be attributed in part to two changes in state law that occurred during the 2010s. A 2014 statutory change allowed community colleges to be funded for in‑person instruction at state prisons (discussed more in the “Funding” section of this report). As'),\n",

As Figure 2 shows, CCC enrollment growth at state prisons was most substantial starting in 2016‑17 (the first full year of colleges offering in‑person instruction) and the subsequent two years. In addition, beginning in 2014, various policy changes have increased people’s ability to earn time off of their prison sentences—known as “credits”—for participating in education programs. (The box below provides more information about these credits.) Whereas CCC enrollment at state prisons has increased over the past decade, overall enrollment across the CCC system has declined by 15 percent Credit‑Earning Opportunities Have Increased at State Prisons. Beginning in 2014, various policy changes have expanded the ability of people in prison to earn time off their sentences.

CDCR used this authority to expand eligibility for credits and increased the amount of time that people can earn off their sentences through credits. Incarcerated Students Can Earn Credits to Reduce Their Prison Sentences. Under current regulations, incarcerated students earn a Milestone Completion Credit (MCC) for every college course completed of at least three semester units (or 4 quarter units) with a grade of “D” or better. MCCs earned through a college course provide one week off a person’s sentence, with students able to earn up to three months off their sentences over a 12‑month period. In addition to MCCs, CDCR awards an Educational Merit Credit (EMC) when an incarcerated student earns a particular degree for the first time. Students can receive multiple EMCs.

With the exception of those sentenced to death or life without the possibility of parole, all people in prison are eligible to earn MCCs and EMCs. Though In‑Person Instruction Has Grown Over Time, Correspondence Courses Remain Most Prevalent. Figure 3 shows that in‑person CCC instruction at CDCR has waxed and waned. In‑person instruction increased gradually—both overall and as a share of total instruction—between 2015‑16 and 2019‑20. At its peak, 48 percent of CCC instruction at prisons was provided in person. With the onset of the pandemic, however, in‑person instruction plummeted and the share of instruction provided via correspondence increased. This is primarily because CDCR suspended most'),\n",

Importantly, the increase of in‑person instruction at the state prisons occurred despite a significant reduction in the overall prison population since the start of the pandemic.

Correspondence and in‑person courses at the state prisons are funded at the same per‑student rate, as is the case for CCC courses provided to the general public. CCC courses at the state prisons are funded based entirely on how many FTE students are enrolled. State Modified Funding Model for Most CCC Instruction. In 2018‑19, the state adopted a new apportionments funding model for community colleges, which placed more emphasis on students achieving positive outcomes and somewhat less emphasis on enrollment.

Despite these types of challenges, students commented that postsecondary education had offered them a number of notable personal benefits, including changing their image of themselves in a positive way, building confidence, developing critical thinking skills, and improving their prospects once they exit prison. Several students also mentioned that postsecondary education had helped them enhance communication with their families. Even those confined to life sentences shared that a CCC education had been beneficial in various ways, including by allowing them to serve as mentors to younger incarcerated persons and inspiring family members on the outside to go to college.

Though neither CDCR nor CCC centrally report the data, based on discussions with CDCR and CCC administrators and our visits to prisons, incarcerated students’ demand for postsecondary courses exceeds the quantity of available courses. As a result of the high demand for these courses, some people can wait up to three years to take their first postsecondary CCC course while in prison.

Some Colleges’ Enrollment Priorities Have Drawbacks. Because demand for a CCC education generally outstrips the number of in‑person slots, colleges must decide which incarcerated people have enrollment priority. Enrollment priority is determined by each college. We found that enrollment prioritization varies across prisons. Some colleges open up registration on a first‑come, first‑served basis. A first‑come, first‑served approach does not take into account whether a student already has a degree or has many years remaining on a sentence. Under this approach, students close to release who do not yet have a degree could be crowded out by students who already have a degree and/or have a significant amount of time left on their sentences. Other colleges avoid these drawbacks by giving enrollment priority to students closest to release and continuing students who are closest to finishing their first associate degree.

With the recent distribution of laptops to students, community colleges and CDCR have an opportunity to rethink how instruction is delivered to students from a distance. This year, several community colleges that are large providers of correspondence courses are piloting a form of online instruction in place of the traditional paper‑and‑mail model. For example, Lake Tahoe Community College is piloting an online synchronous (live) format'),\n",

For security purposes, each course section is being limited to students from the same section of a prison. Other colleges, such as Coastline College and Feather River College, are piloting online models using asynchronous instruction, in which students and faculty have the ability to communicate with and leave messages for each other electronically. Relative to traditional correspondence courses, these online pilots have the potential to provide more efficient and effective ways for students to complete their courses and receive feedback. Having access to a laptop also opens up greater opportunities for students to receive support from counselors and tutors in a more direct and timely way, which could improve student success.

Instead, the associated apportionments funding depends only on enrollment. Without performance‑based funding or some other form of state accountability for student outcomes, colleges lack strong incentives to improve their results. Moreover, given colleges only generate funding through instructional time, support services that might lead to better student outcomes likely are not being prioritized. While community colleges do not collect or report the number of services provided, based on our visits to prisons and our related meetings, relatively few counselors are provided to advise students, with some counselors having a caseload of more than 1,000 incarcerated students. As a result, students tend to have infrequent counseling sessions. Furthermore, incarcerated students typically do not have access to trained tutors, as students have in other community college settings. State Is Missing Opportunity to Use Federal'),\n",

Though the federal government is now offering Pell Grants to eligible incarcerated students, California is receiving no associated benefit from the policy change.

Instead, the state (through both CCC’s and CDCR’s budgets) covers their fees, textbooks, and other education costs. Were the state to begin charging incarcerated CCC students enrollment fees and certain other education expenses (such as laptops), the federal government would fully cover these costs. The state, in turn, would free up both Proposition 98 and non‑Proposition 98 General Fund that could be used for other purposes, including other education purposes.

Because of this lack of evaluation, it is not clear whether the CCC programs are producing the desired results. Legislature Could Improve Policies in Several Ways. In this section, we make several recommendations aimed at addressing the problems and missed opportunities we have identified with CCC education at state prisons. Our recommendations, shown in Figure 9, are focused on enrollment prioritization, space utilization, instructional modality, funding, and oversight. From a technical perspective, most of the recommendations we'),\n",

Developing new space and utilization standards, however, could take more time. In addition, the Legislature likely would want to phase in any funding formula changes to ensure colleges have time to adjust their practices in response to the new fiscal incentives.

Adopt statutory space and utilization standards. Direct CDCR to collect data and report biennially on space utilization. Online pilots Given the generally poor outcomes of correspondence courses, some community colleges and CDCR are working together to pilot new online instructional models. Require CCC and CDCR to report on pilot outcomes, including course success rates compared with in‑person and correspondence courses and impact on faculty recruitment to teach high‑demand courses in prisons.

Under our recommended approach, more individuals are likely to be released from state prison with an associate degree, which in turn could reduce their risk of recidivism and improve their job prospects. Require CDCR to Collect and Report on Space Usage.

Space standards would establish the amount of space (assignable square feet) that should be available on a per‑student basis for classroom purposes as well as other rehabilitation purposes, if space is being used for multiple types of rehabilitation programs. Utilization standards would establish the amount of time that rooms and “stations” (such as a desk or computer terminal) should be used.

Given that several community colleges are implementing online pilots with their CDCR prison partners, we recommend the Legislature request periodic updates on the outcomes of those pilots.

CCC and CDCR also could be tasked with reporting any security‑related concerns with the instructional model being piloted, whether the model creates a better‑quality teaching and learning experience compared with traditional correspondence education, and whether the model allows for community colleges to offer STEM or other high‑demand programs currently not offered. The Legislature could require such an update through an interim legislative report within two years and a final report within five years. To the extent the pilots yield better outcomes, CCC and CDCR could begin changing their programs accordingly. Add Performance Component to Funding Formula Used for Incarcerated Students.

We recommend charging incarcerated students the statutory enrollment fee ($46 per unit). Similarly, we recommended charging incarcerated students for their textbooks. In both cases, federal Pell Grants would reimburse colleges for these costs, with students paying nothing out of pocket. Together, these two recommendations would free up a combined approximately $9 million ongoing Proposition 98 General Fund.

(Due to federal rules, prisons would need to coordinate with their CCC partners so the colleges charge Pell Grant‑eligible students the fee for the laptop rentals and other expenses.

Given students need to complete a FAFSA to obtain a Pell Grant (which typically is due by March each year), the state could make these new fee policies operative commencing in 2025‑26. CCC staff would be responsible for assisting incarcerated students with completing the FAFSA, similar to the FAFSA support CCC staff already provide to other CCC students.

A third risk is that the administration might be underbudgeting CCC apportionment costs. A shortcoming of the plan is that it has no compelling cost basis for the notably different base funding increases proposed for the segments. The plan also does not link university funding increases to specific budget priorities.

The Governor’s budget also assumes no tuition increase at CSU—retaining annual systemwide tuition for a full‑time undergraduate student of $5,742. (Tuition charges at CSU were last raised in 2017‑18, with a 4.9 percent increase in undergraduate tuition assessed that year.) Governor Assumes Tuition Increases Only at UC. In contrast to CCC and CSU, the Governor’s budget continues to assume UC increases tuition annually for certain students, consistent with the Board of Regents’ tuition policy. This policy pegs annual tuition increases to inflation (with certain caps). Incoming undergraduate students and all academic graduate students are subject to the tuition increases. Tuition charges are held flat for continuing undergraduate students. Under the policy, 2023‑24 tuition and systemwide fee rates are set at $13,752 for new undergraduate students and $13,104 for continuing undergraduate students, reflecting a $648 (4.9 percent) increase for new'),\n",

Though the Legislature did not codify these multiyear plans, the Governor’s 2023‑24 higher education budget proposals are consistent with them. The largest component of these plans is annual unrestricted base increases. These base increases are loosely linked with performance expectations in certain areas, including student access, success, and equity; intersegmental coordination; and workforce alignment.

Proposed Base Increase for Colleges Is Higher Than for Universities. As Figure 3 shows, for CCC apportionments (unrestricted base funding), the Governor proposes a $653 million increase to cover an 8.13 percent cost‑of‑living adjustment (COLA). This proposed rate increase is linked to a measure of inflation that will be updated in late April. (The Governor also proposes to grant an 8.13 percent COLA to certain CCC categorical programs as well as certain K‑12 programs.) For CSU and UC, the Governor proposes $227 million and $216 million, respectively, to cover 5 percent base General Fund increases. In addition, the Governor’s budget provides CSU with $39 million ongoing General Fund to cover certain benefit cost increases ($36.7 million for retiree health benefits and $2.6 million for certain pension costs).

Governor Proposes Enrollment Growth at All Three Segments. For CCC, the Governor’s budget includes $29 million to cover 0.5 percent systemwide enrollment growth in 2023‑24, equating to 5.496 additional full‑time equivalent (FTE) students. The Governor also expects CSU and UC to increase resident undergraduate enrollment. For CSU, the Governor assumes growth of 3,434 additional FTE students (1.1 percent) from 2022‑23 to 2023‑24. For UC, the Governor assumes growth of 4,203 additional FTE students (2.1 percent). Although the Governor proposes budget bill language referring to the CCC enrollment funds and growth target, he proposes no such budget provisions for the universities.

Typically, the state has provided CSU and UC with separate appropriations specifically for this purpose on top of the universities’ base increases for core operations. Governor Proposes “Grace Period” for Segments to Reach Enrollment Targets. All three segments are expected to have soft enrollment levels in 2022‑23. Though preliminary systemwide CCC data are not yet available, data from a sample of community colleges suggests systemwide enrollment could be either about flat or up somewhat in 2022‑23 from a depressed 2021‑22 level.

The 2022‑23 Budget Act included language requiring the administration to reduce enrollment growth funding proportionally to any enrollment shortfalls at the universities. Specifically, these budget provisions directed the administration to reduce funding for enrollment shortfalls at CSU in 2022‑23 and at UC in 2023‑24. The Governor, however, is not proposing to reduce any 2022‑23 enrollment growth funding at any of the segments. Instead, the administration effectively is letting each of the segments retain their associated enrollment growth funding in 2022‑23 ($81 million at CSU, $52 million at UC, and $27 million at CCC) and use all or a portion of those funds for other purposes.

Beyond base increases and enrollment growth, the Governor has only a few other higher education spending proposals this year—a stark contrast to the number of higher education spending proposals he has introduced in previous years. Of these remaining proposals, the two most notable ones are related to enrollment. One of these proposals has UC continuing to replace some nonresident students with resident students at its three most selective campuses (Berkeley, Los Angeles, and San Diego).

Budget Solutions Are Not Expected to Create Issues With State Appropriations Limit (SAL). The California Constitution imposes a limit on the amount of revenue the state can appropriate each year. The state can exclude certain capital outlay appropriations from the SAL calculation, effectively making it more manageable to meet the overall SAL requirement.

Governor Focuses on Core Operations. We believe a positive aspect of the Governor’s higher education spending plan is that it has relatively few proposals and those proposals have a strong focus on access and preserving the segments’ core operations. We believe focusing on core operations and not scattering funds across many programs and new initiatives is a better budget approach, especially given the current state fiscal context.

In particular, focusing on core operations helps the segments address inflationary pressures; respond to employee recruitment, retention, and compensation issues; and sustain program quality. Higher Education Spending Plan Has No New Structural Shortfalls in 2023‑24. The Governor’s budget does not support any new ongoing higher education costs with one‑time funding. (The Governor’s budget funds some ongoing Middle Class Scholarship costs with one‑time funding, but the Legislature previously agreed to this action.) Though no new structural shortfalls emerge within higher education, the Governor proposes funding $1.4 billion in ongoing K‑12 Local Control Funding Formula (LCFF) costs with one‑time funds (an issue we discuss in more detail in our forthcoming Proposition 98 budget brief). This structural shortfall in the K‑12 budget would heighten budget challenges for school districts in 2024‑25. Importantly, the main reason the Governor is able to avoid a'),\n",

Last year, the community college budget had a proportionally larger budget cushion than school districts. Because the Governor’s higher education spending plan does not have any new core operating shortfall akin to the LCFF shortfall, the higher education segments would be in a stronger fiscal position than school districts entering 2024‑25. (The Governor’s budget, however, might have underbudgeted CCC apportionments, as discussed in the next section.) More Flexibility Could Enable Community Colleges to Serve Students Better. Over the past several years, the state has created many additional CCC categorical programs. The proliferation of these programs has increased colleges’ administrative burden and exacerbated program silos, which, in turn, likely have generated'),\n",

Were the Governor this spring to introduce a flexibility proposal for the colleges, we believe it could be worth pursuing.

Additional flexibility in operating programs and reporting on the outcomes of those programs might allow the colleges to better serve students, including by allowing them to dedicate more time to student support rather than administration. Ongoing Proposals Present a Risk to State Budget Moving Forward. Though we believe the Governor’s higher education spending plan has certain positive aspects, it also has some risks and shortcomings. One risk is linked to the proposed CSU and UC base increases, as these ongoing General Fund augmentations are contributing factors to the state budget deficits that arise under the multiyear outlook. Were the'),\n",

Were the state revenue situation to deteriorate further, any ongoing General Fund augmentations made in 2023‑24 will become harder for the state to sustain over the near term. Under some revenue scenarios, the state would face difficulty affording future base increases for CSU and UC over the next few years. Proposed Budget Solutions Provide Temporary Fix. A second, related risk emanates from the Governor’s proposed higher education budget solutions. The proposed funding delays and cost shifts (for example, with certain CSU and UC capital projects) provide General Fund savings in 2023‑24, but they do so merely by shifting costs out one or more years. Importantly, nearly all the higher education budget solutions in 2023‑24 immediately turn into budget challenges in 2024‑25. Community College Apportionment Costs Might Be Underbudgeted. A third risk in the Governor’s budget relates to how it implements a “funding stability” provision that applies to community colleges. This'),\n",

This provision protects community college districts from sudden drops in funding due to uncontrollable events. Over the past several years, relatively few community college districts have been affected by this statutory protection, in part because extraordinary pandemic‑related hold harmless provisions have been in place. In 2023‑24, for various reasons (including the expiration of these other hold harmless provisions), many districts could be affected by the funding stability provision. The way the Governor’s budget calculates the cost of this provision differs from the Chancellor’s Office’s interpretation, and we believe it could understate the cost of funding CCC apportionments. The Legislature likely will want to investigate these differences more closely in the coming weeks to determine if an apportionment shortfall exists in 2023‑24 and, if so, identify options for responding. We plan to cover this issue in more detail in our forthcoming community college budget brief.'),\n",

Community Colleges and Universities Are Treated Differently Despite Similarities. Under the Governor’s budget, community colleges receive larger base funding increases than the universities, with the 8.13 percent COLA for the colleges roughly comparable to the universities’ approximately 4 percent increases in core funding. Though different base increases for each of the segments could be justified, the administration offers no compelling cost or program basis for such differences this year. (The higher COLA rate for community colleges is due entirely to the colleges being a part of Proposition 98 calculations. These calculations, however, do not have a strong nexus to underlying community college cost pressures.) Moreover, the three segments have similar cost drivers. All are experiencing salary pressures, increases in their health care premiums, increases in their pension contribution rates, and inflationary pressures in other key areas, including utilities, supplies,'),\n",

University Augmentations Are Not Clearly Tied to Budget Priorities. Whereas the community college apportionment formula is designed so that districts effectively are required to earn their base funding increases, the state has no such funding requirements for the universities. Specifically, for community colleges, the Student Centered Funding Formula allocates funds based upon enrollment counts, certain student group counts (including low‑income student counts), and performance outcomes (including transfer rates and degree attainment rates). Colleges with more enrollment, serving more low‑income students, and achieving better outcomes (including for their low‑income students) generally earn more funding than other colleges.

During this period, the labor market also has been historically strong, with many job openings. Though the incoming freshman class at CSU rebounded from fall 2021 to fall 2022, those rebounds have not been enough to offset the enrollment declines driven by these other factors.

Typically, capital projects move through standard phases, beginning with preliminary plans and working drawings, followed by construction. State funding, in turn, is linked with these phases. The state tends to provide a relatively small amount of funding the first year or two of projects as planning work is undertaken and construction cost estimates are refined. It then provides the bulk of project funding in year two or three once construction commences. In contrast to these standard budget practices, UC capital outlay projects under the Governor’s budget solution proposals would get a substantial round of initial funding in 2022‑23 (much more'),\n",

As of the time of this writing, it was not yet clear how UC would respond to these fluctuations in project funding. The proposed approach, however, is questionable, as it disconnects funding from specific project activities—likely providing too much project funding too soon and then delaying funding even when projects could be shovel ready. It also places UC projects in a particularly risky position, with large amounts already provided for each project, but large amounts of remaining project funding not guaranteed. CSU Budget Solutions Could Be Crowding Out Higher‑Priority Projects. As part of his budget solutions, the Governor is proposing to provide CSU with an ongoing $27 million General Fund augmentation to cover debt service on six capital budgets (rather than providing $405 million upfront for the projects).

By comparison, most of the six projects that would receive financing in 2023‑24 under the Governor’s budget are for new facilities or expansions. Moreover, some of these projects were not identified in CSU’s 2022‑23 five‑year capital plan, indicating that the campus and the system had not considered them among their highest and most urgent capital priorities.

We end by highlighting major higher education initiatives for which the Legislature might wish to conduct oversight. Link University Funding Increases More Tightly With Spending Priorities. Overall, we continue to recommend the Legislature take a more transparent budget approach for the universities. In contrast to the Governor’s approach, the Legislature could identify its budget priorities in 2023‑24 and provide funding linked to those priorities. For example, with the same total ongoing funding increase that the Governor proposes for CSU ($227 million), the Legislature could fund a 3 percent increase in CSU’s employee compensation pool ($157 million), certain health benefit increases ($51 million), and some capital renewal projects ($20 million). (Growing resident undergraduate enrollment by 1 percent would cost approximately $35 million, but CSU is not expecting to grow'),\n",

Consider Expanding Budget Capacity at CSU Through Tuition Increases. Under the Governor’s budget, CSU fares worst among the segments from a fiscal perspective, receiving a smaller base increase than CCC and no additional revenue from tuition increases as UC does. Moreover, CSU is unable to cover all of its projected operating cost increases within the Governor’s proposed 5 percent base funding increase. (We compare CSU’s and UC’s funding and operating cost increases in the nearby box.) Given this shortfall, the state could consider expanding CSU’s budget capacity by supporting tuition increases beginning either in 2023‑24 or 2024‑25. Importantly, pursuing tuition increases in 2023‑24 would require quick action over the next few months whereas pursuing them for 2024‑25 would allow ample time for consultation and notification.

Begin Developing a Plan to Keep Existing Campus Facilities in Good Condition. Though each of the higher education segments has an extensive footprint, with some building components reaching the end of their useful life each year, neither the state nor the segments have a plan for funding these capital renewal projects. Moreover, neither the CCC roadmap nor university compacts include any discussion of how the segments and state should address capital renewal. Furthermore, the Governor’s budget includes no funding increases specifically for keeping colleges’ or universities’ existing academic facilities and infrastructure in good condition.

Perhaps unsurprisingly given these factors, spending on capital renewal to date has been insufficient to keep pace with emerging needs, and project backlogs have been large and growing. Absent a plan to address these issues moving forward, project backlogs very likely will continue to grow—leading to higher costs and greater risk of programmatic disruptions. We recommend the Legislature work with the segments to begin developing capital renewal plans. Such plans likely would involve several key elements, including setting a funding target that is aligned with emerging needs, sharing the cost between the state and the segments, and phasing in funding increases over time.

All of these factors make the trade‑offs among capital projects and across the capital and operating sides of the segments’ budgets more difficult.

Were the Legislature to decide that certain capital projects are worth approving in 2023‑24, it could consider the most advantageous way to finance those projects.

More projects, however, likely could be financed over the near term. Given these significant trade‑offs, the Legislature could consider establishing some criteria for when to finance a project using upfront cash versus borrowing. The method the state selects for financing projects could depend in part upon its relative near‑term and long‑term fiscal outlook, with borrowing more preferable if the near‑term situation is poor but the long‑term outlook is strong. As it has typically done, the state also could require projects to meet criteria such as addressing a critical life‑safety issue or mitigating overcrowding, with a somewhat more stringent threshold used for projects that incur interest costs.

Could Recognize Savings Due to Enrollment Declines. Rather than allowing the segments to use enrollment growth funding in 2022‑23 for other purposes, the Legislature could reduce enrollment funding proportionally to enrollment declines or, for CCC, sweep unearned growth funding. Once the segments begin growing their enrollment, the Legislature could provide corresponding funding at that time. Under this approach, the state could achieve up to an additional $133 million in non‑Proposition 98 General Fund savings ($81 million at CSU and $52 million at UC), while potentially freeing up several millions of dollars in Proposition 98 funding at CCC.

Janes sought to establish a normal school for San Francisco's public school system, and approached George W. Minns to be the principal for the nascent institution, with Swett as an assistant principal.[14][15] The normal school began operations in 1857 and became known as the Minns Evening Normal School.

On the December 15th, 1868 board of trustees meeting, State Superintendent Oscar P.

After its destruction, Principal Charles H. Allen journeyed to Sacramento to request the California State Legislator for emergency funds for a new building. This caused significant debate in the senate about the effectiveness of the school and if it would be better served elsewhere.

The area where Allegheny College stands was the ancestral land of the Eriechronon people until the Iroquois Confederacy forced them out.[8] Having been displaced from their ancestral lands in what is now Eastern Pennsylvania, the Lenape or Delaware Tribe moved into the now unoccupied region. They formed an alliance with the neighboring Seneca, one of the five tribes that made up the Iroquois Confederacy, and other displaced Lenape.

Allegheny College was founded in April 1815[12][13] by Timothy Alden, a graduate of Harvard's School of Divinity. The college has been affiliated with the United Methodist Church since 1833 but does not integrate religion into the classroom or pedagogy. The first class, consisting of four male students, began their studies on July 4, 1816, without any formal academic buildings. Within six years, Alden accumulated sufficient funds to begin building a campus. The first building erected, the library, was designed by Alden himself, and is a notable example of early American architecture. Bentley Hall is named in honor of Dr. William Bentley, who donated his private library to the college, a collection of considerable value and significance. In 1824, Thomas Jefferson wrote to Alden, expressing the hope that his University of Virginia could someday possess the richness of Allegheny's library.[14] Alden served as president of the college until 1831 when financial and enrollment\"),\n",

Tarbell described Ruter Hall in her writing, \"...looking out on the town in the valley, its roofs and towers half hidden by a wealth of trees, and beyond it to a circle of round-breasted hills. Before I left Allegheny I had found a very precious thing in that severe room--the companionship there is in the silent presence of books.\"[17] In 1905, Allegheny built Alden Hall as a new and improved preparatory school.[12] Over the decades, the college has grown in size and significance while still maintaining ties to the community.

Juris Doctor programs at law schools are usually three-year programs if done full-time, or four-year programs if done via evening classes. Some U.S. law schools include an Accelerated JD program.

Many law schools offer substantial scholarships and grants to many of their students, dramatically reducing the actual cost of attending law school compared to sticker tuition.

The \"median\" system seeks to provide some parity among teachers\\' grading scales while giving the teacher discretion to award a grade below the median only when deserved. Fairness and equity are the primary reasons for required curves and required grade distributions.

This process is intended to train students in the reasoning methods necessary to interpret theories, statutes, and precedents correctly, and argue their validity, both orally and in writing.

Before 1870, there was nothing like a modern university in America, only a number of glorified liberal arts colleges which taught Greek, Latin, moral philosophy, and mathematics to undergraduates.[33] The early law departments attached to these purported universities, such as the ones at Harvard and Yale, were in competition for those same undergraduates.[34] Students at the time chose law school or college, but not both.[35] Law schools were technical schools with \"second-class status\" which usually had lower admissions standards than the colleges they were competing against for undergraduates.[36] For example, in 1904, Hugo Black was denied admission to the University of'),\n",

Additionally, the Board of Governors defined economic development as one of the core missions of the California Community College System.

The current claim of the Administration of the University of San Carlos is that the institution was originally founded as the Colegio de San Ildefonso, a grammar school attached to the Jesuit residence in Cebu. It was established by Spanish Jesuit missionaries Antonio Sedeño, Pedro Chirino and Antonio Pereira in 1595. The Colegio de San Ildefonso was closed in 1769 with the expulsion of the Jesuits from Spain and the Spanish dominions. Prompted by the decree of the Council of Trent that every diocese must have a seminary for the formation and training of priests, Bishop Mateo Joaquin de Arevalo, in a letter dated 25 October 1777, petitioned Charles III of Spain for the legal bequest of the buildings of the old Colegio de San Ildefonso.

In 1825, the Seminary's first rector, Fr. José Morales del Rosario, was appointed by the Dominican Bishop Francisco Genoves, and was followed by a series of secular rectors until 1867.

In 1867, the Seminary was formally turned over to Fr. José Casarramona, CM., who became rector. On 15 May 1867, in response to the local elite\\'s petition to allow their sons to study, the Seminary allowed laymen to study as externs (colegiales), by decree of Bishop Jimeno: \"...in order that they may be duly instructed in science and virtue.”[6] A royal decree dated 20 May 1865 called for a system of Secondary Education (Segunda Enseñanza) which introduced a well-planned program for a five-year course of Humanistic Studies leading to the degree of Bachiller en Artes (Bachelor of Arts).

The decree vested to the University of Santo Tomas in Manila, through its Rector, the direction, supervision and responsibility for the good running of such schools; the conduct of final examinations at the end of the five-year course; and the awarding of all diplomas of the Bachelor of Arts degree. The first of such schools in Cebu was only founded in 1887 by Martin Logarta, which closed down two years after. In response, in 1887 Bishop Martin Alcocer of Cebu pleaded to the Vincentian administration of the Seminario-Colegio de San Carlos to send more personnel in order to comply with government standards. The University of Santo Tomas recognized the five-year program of the Seminario-Colegio de San Carlos, and in 1894, the first batch of Cebuanos arrived in Manila and passed the examination for the Bachelor of Arts degree.[6] USC\\'s claims as the \"oldest educational institution or school in Asia\" has been a long time subject of disputes with the University of Santo Tomas'),\n",

Jose Casarramona welcomed the first lay students to attend classes at the Seminario de San Carlos.”[10][11] Thus, he says that San Carlos cannot claim to have descended from the Colegio de San Ildefonso founded by the Jesuits in 1595, despite taking over the latter\\'s facilities when the Jesuits were expelled by Spanish authorities in 1769.

The ASB Student Senate overlooks the independent clubs as well as the men's and women's social service clubs that used to be under the now-defunct Associated Men's Students (AMS) and Associated Women's Students (AWS). LBCC is also known for having a nationally renowned volunteer service program, as well as the oldest community college intramural athletics program in the nation. There are campus-run radio and television stations, as well as a campus-run newspaper, named the Viking. Traditional events include Homecoming Week, the Spring Sing variety show, and Mini Grand Prix, a three-man push-cart race tournament. Each of the campuses has its own Alpha Gamma Sigma chapter.

In 1907, Lange worked with state senator Anthony Caminetti to bring about the enactment of the Upward Extension Act, the first state law in the United States to formally authorize the creation of junior colleges.[5] Senator Caminetti represented rural Amador County.[6] As articulated by Caminetti, the original rationales for junior colleges were financial, geographical, and practical.[6] Amador County and other rural counties were hundreds of miles away from the state's only universities of any significance at the time: UC Berkeley, Stanford, and the University of Southern California.[6]\"),\n",

The state's goal was to train and place one million workers in middle-skill jobs, meaning jobs requiring some education beyond a high school diploma which may include a college credential, but not a four-year degree. A core barrier to the growth of CTE careers is the outdated view about the jobs being dirty and low paying. Annual events such as Manufacturing Day address these misperceptions of careers in the field by providing manufacturers an opportunity to bring middle and high school students into their facilities to display the skills required in certain fields.

Different universities emphasize different factors in their evaluations.[129] Before 1986, students who wanted to apply to UC for undergraduate study could only apply to one campus. Students who were rejected at that campus but otherwise met the UC minimum eligibility requirements were redirected to another campus with available space.[130][131] Students who did not want to be redirected were refunded their application fees.[citation needed] UC Riverside chancellor Ivan Hinderaker explained in 1972: \"Redirection has been a negative rather'),\n",

Some come with a chip on their shoulders so big they never give the campus a chance. They poison the attitudes of the students around them.\"[131] Therefore, in 1986, the undergraduate application system was changed to the current \"multiple filing\" system, in which students can apply to as many or as few UC campuses as they want on one application, paying a fee for each campus. This significantly increased the number of applications to the Berkeley and Los Angeles campuses, since students could choose a campus to attend after they received acceptance letters, without fear of being redirected to a campus they did not want to attend.[130] The University of California accepts fully eligible students from among the top one-eighth (1/8) of California public high school graduates through regular statewide admission, or the top 9% of any given high school class through Eligibility in the Local Context (see below).

The California Geological Survey provides scientific analysis of the state's geology, seismic hazards, and mineral resources. Historically, CGS began as a short-lived California Geological Survey (1860–1874). In 1880, the California Legislature created the State Mining Bureau, which focused solely on mining and mineral resources and reported directly to the Governor.

Each Code Commission was a one- or two-year temporary agency which either closed at the end of the authorized period or was reauthorized and rolled over into the next period; thus, in some years there was no Code Commission.[8] The first four codes enacted in 1872 were the Civil Code, the Code of Civil Procedure, the Penal Code, and the Political Code.[9][10] Statutes that did not fit these categories were simply left uncodified in the California Statutes. The four original California Codes were not drafted from scratch, but were mostly adapted by the Code Commission from codes prepared for the state of New York by the great law reformer David Dudley Field II.[10][11] As a result of the Gold Rush, many New York lawyers had migrated to California, including Field's brother, Stephen Johnson Field, who would ultimately serve as California's fifth\"),\n",

In turn, it was the California Practice Act that served as the foundation of the California Code of Civil Procedure. New York never enacted Field's proposed civil or political codes, and belatedly enacted his proposed penal and criminal procedure codes only after California, but they were the basis of the codes enacted by California in 1872.[11] As noted above, the initial four codes were not fully comprehensive.

By 1953, when the Code Commission completed its assigned task and issued its final report on September 1 of that year, 25 Codes were then in existence.[10] That year, the legislature replaced the Code Commission with the California Law Revision Commission.[8][10] Since then, the CLRC has been tasked'),\n",

Although there is a Code of Civil Procedure, there is no Code of Criminal Procedure.[1] Instead, criminal procedure in California is codified in Part 2 of the Penal Code, while Part 1 is devoted to substantive criminal law. The Codes contain, or are supposed to only contain general statutory law, with the emphasis on the word \"general\".[10] The legislature also regularly enacts a variety of other resolutions which are not laws of general application, such as annual budget bills, appropriation bills for specific periods of time, acts authorizing the purchase or disposition of land by the state government, and acts authorizing the'),\n",

The Civil Code is particularly difficult to understand since the Supreme Court of California has treated parts of the Code as a mere restatement of the common law. For example, in Li v.

They hoped to create new institutions infused with public morality and purpose.[8] However, in the early years of California's modern development the population had remained largely mobile, moving from opportunity to opportunity, making it almost impossible for the state to create permanent public schools that could effectively educate children from start to finish.

The 1960 Master Plan is embodied in several documents: Kerr stated that the goal of the Master Plan was to balance the \"competing demands of fostering excellence and guaranteeing educational access for all.\"[13] The Master Plan achieved the following: According to the plan, the top one-eighth (12.5%) of graduating high school seniors would be guaranteed a place at a campus of the University of California tuition-free. The top one-third (33.3%) would be able to enter the California State University system. Junior colleges (later renamed \"community colleges\" in 1967) would accept any students \"capable of benefiting from instruction.\"[11] These percentages are now enforced by sliding scales equating grade point average and scores on the SAT or ACT, which are recalculated every year.

This practice was carried over from previous years before the plan was enacted; graduates from the junior colleges had traditionally been accepted as upper-division transfer students at the state colleges or UC campuses by virtue of their prior coursework. Finally, the plan established that the University of California would be the sole portion of the system charged with performing research, and would award master\\'s and doctoral degrees in support of that mission. The Cal State system, in addition to awarding master\\'s degrees, would be able to award joint doctorates with the UC.[11] The \"California Idea\"—California\\'s tripartite system of public research universities, comprehensive 4-year undergraduate campuses, and open-access community colleges—has been highly influential, and many other states and even nations have imitated this structure.[14]'),\n",

As Kerr explained in his memoirs: \"The state did not need a higher education system where every component was intent on being another Harvard or Berkeley or Stanford.\"[18] Faculty members at state colleges regarded them as \"graveyards of disappointed expectations\" and wished they were located at the research universities from which they had obtained their doctoral degrees.[17] Therefore, the plan was intended to concentrate state resources at the top, rather than spreading them too thin among far too many would-be research universities.[18]'),\n",
