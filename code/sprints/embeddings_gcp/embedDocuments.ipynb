      "page_content='MiraCosta College is a public community college serving coastal Northern San Diego County in California with two campuses, one in eastern Oceanside and the other in Cardiff-by-the-Sea, and many satellite locations, including the Community Learning Center in western Oceanside. MiraCosta was founded in 1934. Classes began in a wing at Oceanside High School. Originally, MiraCosta was known as Oceanside-Carlsbad Junior College. There were 122 students enrolled and 20 faculty members. It was the second community college to be established in San Diego County. Only 16 courses were initially offered, and they counted as credit toward advanced standing at the University of California. [citation needed] By 1959, enrollment in Oceanside-Carlsbad Junior College had grown to 500 full-time students in classrooms on 30 acres (12 ha) adjacent to Oceanside High School. In 1960, voters approved a separate community college district and a bond issue to provide funding for a new college campus.[citation' metadata={'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MiraCosta_College'}\n",

The name MiraCosta (Spanish for \"behold the coast\") refers to the panoramic ocean and coastal mountain views from the campus. The property was purchased for $575,000 and was part of a parcel owned by renowned ice skater Sonja Henie. A neighborhood in Oceanside named Henie Hills is to the west of the campus.[citation needed] The district once again expanded in 1976 to include all of the North County coastal communities from Camp Pendleton to Del Mar. By 1978, enrollment was more than 7,000 students. A satellite campus opened in Del Mar in a vacant elementary school. This campus served students who lived in the southern portion of the district. In the first semester, 1,034 credit students enrolled. Soon after, MiraCosta purchased a 48-acre (19 ha) parcel near the San Elijo Lagoon in Cardiff-by-the-Sea.

The center has expanded its adult education offerings to include parenting classes, workshops for older adults, and programs for those who are physically and mentally challenged. The Cisco Academy, offering training in computer networking, is also housed at the center. The college's Small Business Development Center is next door.[3] In 2002, MiraCosta opened the doors to its new Child Development Center on the Oceanside Campus, which provides both academic instruction to students and child care services to student, staff, and community families. The curriculum is specifically designed to encourage early childhood learning.[citation needed] The Oceanside Campus opened a significantly larger library in 2003.[citation needed] In November 2005, MiraCosta, in partnership with Genentech and other' metadata={'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MiraCosta_College'}\n",

In March 2009, MiraCosta welcomed new superintendent/president Francisco Rodriguez.[citation needed] Controversy erupted in 2007 regarding fraud over illegal sale of palm trees. Subsequent investigations, lawsuits and resignations involved former president Dr. Victoria Muñoz Richart, former horticultural department director and instructor Alleen Texiera, and the board of trustees. [4] The college was then placed on warning by its accrediting agency,[5] which was eventually reversed after administrative changes. After 10 years all lawsuits were settled which cumulatively cost the college a total of $5 million.[6] In 2015, MiraCosta introduced a scholarship for transgender students.[7] MiraCosta College offers associate degrees equivalent to the first two years of a bachelor's degree (2+2 program).

The total cost of the degree is estimated to be approximately $10,000. MiraCosta College's men's/women's basketball and soccer teams compete in the Pacific Coast Conference.
